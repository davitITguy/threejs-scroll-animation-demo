          I'm a Stark's mentality person, always IMPROVE and use every FAILURE for building SUCCESS.
        </p>

        <p>
          Little summery about me for years I tried to learn programing by online courses without practice which didn't helped but gave me deep theoretical knowledge and for some time im focused on practice. My PROS and CONS are : Excellent problem solving ability I have strong will and mindset to achieve goals. Cons : Because of past mistakes sometimes I'm not confident.

        <h2>👩🏽‍🚀 Projects</h2>

        <p>
          There are few projects which were really fun to do lets start with <a class="specialLinks" href='project sources/dad-jokes/index.html' target="_blank">Dad Jokes Generator</a> with api we get id the joke itself and status and we fetch api and build it into projects. There are few projects with api which I can share later, next projects is a <a class="specialLinks" href="project sources/movie/index.html" target="_blank">Movie App</a> there's a site called moviedb which gives huge data of movies, after some work time came for styling and filtering it took a while but at the end its one of my favorite projects. Theres a lot more from Udemy's 50 Projects in 50 Days course.
